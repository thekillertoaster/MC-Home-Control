Pull requests are welcome. If I feel you have contributed greatly to the project, I will add you to the credits

### Setup Tutorial

1. Webserver

	1. Navigate to 'webfiles' and go through each of the PHP files and set the custom variables.

	2. upload these webfiles to a webserver and verify that you can navigate the menu.

2. Computercraft	

	1. In your minecraft session, place down a computer (computercraft) and type in the following commands:

	2. 'pastebin get <pastebin code> startup'

	3. 'edit startup'

	4. Go through and configure the program with your webserver.

	5. Press Ctrl and the navigate to save.

	6. Hold Ctrl + R to restart the computer.

Note: You will know that you setup the computer right because on startup, it will show a screen saying "Listening for inputs"

Depending on the program that you loaded, the outputs of the computer will be different. Please refer to pastebin.txt for information regarding the outputs of each node.

For ease of use, I have also included the raw lua files for each computercraft node.
